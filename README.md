# MARAC_API_Workshop
Resources used in the "There's An API for that!" workshops sponsored by the Mid-Atlantic Regional Archives Conference in 2017.

## Authenticating with secrets.py
Several scripts used for interacting with the ArchivesSpace API call a separate secrets.py that should be in the following format:

'''
backendurl='YOURBACKENDURL'
user='YOURUSER'
password='YOURPASSWORD'
'''
